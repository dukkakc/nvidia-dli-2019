##  Computer Requirements:

* You will need to bring your own laptop for the workshop. This will be used both for running software locally and connecting to SDSCâ€™s supercomputers.

##  Account Requirements:

* You will be given a temporary training account on the SDSC Comet computer. Information on the account will be sent to you via email. Please complete the process of activating your account before the institute begins. You'll have about 1 week to migrate any material off of the training account once the workshop is over.
* If you wish to continue working on comet, you can request a trial account here: https://www.sdsc.edu/services/hpc/hpc_systems.html#comet
* For longer term accounts, you will need to apply for an allocation. For more information, see:  https://portal.xsede.org/allocations/announcements#types-trial
